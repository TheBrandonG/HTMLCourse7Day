      <h2>Interesting Facts About HTML</h2>
      <h3>History of HTML</h3>
      <p>
        HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, was created by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It was the first language that allowed the creation of structured documents by defining structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
      </p>
      <h3>Purpose of HTML</h3>
      <p>
        HTML is used to create web pages and web applications. It describes the structure of a webpage and, along with CSS and JavaScript, forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
      </p>
      <h3>Evolution of HTML</h3>
      <p>
        Since its inception, HTML has undergone several updates. The current version, HTML5, was published in October 2014 and includes new elements, attributes, and behaviors, as well as a larger set of technologies that allow for more diverse and powerful websites and applications.
